# Political Cartography of the Turkish Republic: A Quantitative Text Analysis

This is the R script of my paper "Political Cartography of the Turkish Republic: A Quantitative Text Analysis" about the structure of political elites in Turkey between 2011 and 2021 with automated text analysis approaches.
My coding is not good, but it would be expected to give the analysis in the paper.
## Data ##
I use the parliamentary speeches that I obtained from https://www.clarin.eu/parlamint, which is a collection of parliamentary datasets (corpora) in a number of languages from different national parliaments.
## Word embeddings ##
I uploaded FastText's Turkish embeddings into R from the link that I obtained from personal communication with Dustin Stoltz.
